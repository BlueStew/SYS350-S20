Since this lab was in a walk through lab, I just followed the on screen instructions.  Certain parts I had to look up myself because the
instruction were either unclear or referenced other information that either wasn't explained or was not visible on the screen.

In terms of an alternative way to do this, this was a walk through lab.  In terms of SRM, CLI is always an option.
