1. Installed and Configured ESXI on a Second Server
2. Create a database in vShpere 
3. Create a network adapter (switch)
4. Using the new network adapter, create portgroups as vlans and label them

ALT
1Get the datacenter where you want to create the vSphere distributed switch.
$myDatacenter = Get-Datacenter -Name "MyDatacenter"

2Get all hosts in your datacenter.
$vmHosts = $myDatacenter | Get-VMHost

3
Create a new vSphere distributed switch.
$myVDSwitch = New-VDSwitch -Name "MyVDSwitch" -Location $myDatacenter
The distributed switch is created with no port groups.
4	Add the hosts in your datacenter to the distributed switch.
Add-VDSwitchVMHost -VDSwitch $myVDSwitch -VMHost $vmHosts

5
Get a physical network adapter from your hosts.
$hostsPhysicalNic = $vmHosts | Get-VMHostNetworkAdapter -Name "vmnic2"

6
Add the physical network adapter to the distributed switch that you created.
Add-VDSwitchPhysicalNetworkAdapter -VMHostNetworkAdapter $hostsPhysicalNic -DistributedSwitch $myVDSwitch

7
Create a new distributed port group with 1000 ports and add it to the distributed switch.
$myVDPortGroup = New-VDPortgroup -Name "MyVMsPortGroup" -VDSwitch $myVDSwitch -NumPorts 1000

8
Connect all virtual machines running on the hosts in your datacenter to the distributed port group.
$vmHosts | Get-VM | Get-NetworkAdapter | Set-NetworkAdapter -PortGroup $myVDPortGroup
